      <h3>A good title.</h3>
      <p>Immigration in EU</p>
      <h3>WHAT the visualizations show;</h3>
      <p>We show two of the top concerns of immigrants in Europe which are health and employment. Because they are
        usually
        the main reasons why people choose to leave their home country and the main factors when deciding on which
        country
        to move to.</p>

      <h3>WHO the visualization is for</h3>
      <p>Not only are immigrants concerned about the employment rates and health of their own groups, but residents of
        European countries are also concerned about employment rates and the health of immigrants. Because international
        immigrants play an important role in population growth and employment in receiving countries. Local residents
        will
        also want to know if their employment and health care will be affected by immigration.</p>

      <h3>WHY we the audience should care about it;</h3>
      <p>The audience is likely to be a member of the European immigrant community or a native European. At least we are
        now studying in a European country and we have a lot of exposure to immigrants so that the issue of immigration
        is
        relevant to us.</p>

      <h3>HOW to read the visualization.</h3>
      <p>Our main picture shows a map of Europe, the shades of color represent the health status of immigrants in each
        country, and the size of the circles on each country reflects the employment status of immigrants. Viewers can
        change the year of data displayed on the map by dragging the timeline. Employment and health statistics for
        immigrants are displayed when the mouse is hovered over each country. When the viewer clicks on a country, two
        graphs appear showing in more detail the health and employment situation of immigrants.</p>
