      <p> Unpacking the Employment and Health Status of Immigrants in EU: A Data Analysis of the Past Decade
        (2012-2021)
      </p>
      <h3>WHAT the visualizations show</h3>
      <p>Our visualizations depict two significant concerns of immigrants in Europe: health and employment. These
        factors
        are crucial determinants for individuals leaving their home countries and choosing a new destination. By
        highlighting these issues, we aim to shed light on the challenges that immigrants face and provide insights that
        can inform policies and programs to better support their integration and well-being.</p>

      <h3>WHO the visualization is for</h3>
      <p>Our visualizations are intended for a diverse audience, including immigrants, policymakers, researchers, and
        residents of European countries. Immigrants can gain insights into the employment and health status of their
        community and use this information to make informed decisions about their own lives. Policymakers and
        researchers can use the data to develop evidence-based policies and programs that promote the integration and
        well-being of immigrants. Additionally, residents of European countries can gain a better understanding of the
        impact of immigration on employment and healthcare and use this knowledge to promote social cohesion and
        effective resource allocation. As international immigrants play a significant role in population growth and
        employment in receiving countries, our visualizations can provide valuable information for all stakeholders
        concerned with immigration-related issues.</p>

      <h3>WHY we the audience should care about it</h3>
      <p>There are several compelling reasons why all members of our diverse audience should care about our analysis of
        immigrant employment and health status in Europe.</p>

      <p>For members of the European immigrant community, our analysis provides valuable insights into the challenges
        and
        opportunities that exist for individuals seeking employment and healthcare services in a new country. By
        examining the data, we can better understand the barriers that immigrants face in accessing these critical
        services and work towards developing effective policies and programs to promote greater equity and inclusion.
      </p>

      <p>For native Europeans, our analysis is equally important, as it sheds light on the important contributions that
        immigrants make to our economy and our communities. By understanding the challenges that immigrants face in
        finding employment and accessing healthcare, we can identify ways to better support their integration and
        improve their overall well-being. Moreover, our analysis can provide a basis for informed discussion and
        dialogue on issues related to immigration, helping to promote greater understanding and social cohesion.</p>

      <p>For individuals who are currently studying in Europe, our analysis provides an opportunity to learn about and
        engage with critical issues related to immigration. By examining the data and exploring the factors that affect
        immigrant employment and health status, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of the complex challenges
        that immigrants face. This knowledge can help us to become more informed and engaged citizens, who are better
        equipped to promote social justice and inclusion in our communities.</p>

      <p>In summary, regardless of our backgrounds or perspectives, there are numerous reasons why we should care about
        our analysis of immigrant employment and health status in Europe. By examining the data and working towards
        greater understanding and awareness, we can promote greater equity and inclusion, and work towards creating a
        more just and prosperous society for all.</p>

      <h3>HOW to read the visualization</h3>
      <p>Our main picture shows a map of Europe, the shades of color represent the health status of immigrants in each
        country, and the size of the circles in each country reflects the employment status of immigrants. Viewers can
        change the year of data displayed on the map by dragging the timeline. Employment and health statistics for
        immigrants are displayed when the mouse is hovered over each country. When the viewer clicks on a country, two
        graphs appear showing in more detail the health and employment situation of immigrants.</p>
